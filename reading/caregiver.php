        <p>Dear <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>,</p>

        <p>If you’ve made it here, then congratulations! Because this means that your archetype is the Caregiver! But what does this actually mean? Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page. Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll <span class="purple">experience something truly magical.</span></p>

        <p>The Archetypal Identifier that you’ve recently used is designed to help you uncover your personality profile... Or, what we also know as your archetype - an in-depth examination of your entire being...</p>

        <!--Insert Archetypal Wheel Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your <span class="purple">tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</span></p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make <span class="purple">astronomical changes</span> in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>You can use it to identify and re-construct your weaknesses...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Caregiver, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, You Are The Caregiver - And This Is <span class="purple">What It Means...</span></h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are an individual who posseses great capacities of love... An individual whose <span class="purple">sole purpose</span> is to give large chunks of yourself to others.</p>

        <p>That being said, you truly are a unique individual, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... And needless to say, the world certainly needs more people like you.</p>

        <p>And despite your seemingly simple appearances, you're definitely <span class="purple">a whole lot smarter</span> than you make yourself out to be. In other words, because of your archetype, there's no doubt that you possess a profound level of intelligence...</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/caregiver.png">

        <p>...A level of intelligence that is <span class="purple">not merely limited to academics.</span></p>

        <p>But... Because of your humble and mild-mannered nature, you'd very much prefer to hide that specific trait about you.</p>

        <p>You'd very much rather be underestimated than overestimated, isn't that right, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>?</p>

        <p>You're also deeply sensitive when it comes to other's emotions - your emotional quotient amongst the highest in the archetypes... Allowing you to experience the pains, struggles, and happiness of others...</p>

        <p>Your selflessness comes unparalleled, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. You're always so ready to give to others - whether its in the form of <span class="purple">time</span> through volunteering, in the form of <span class="purple">money</span> through donations, or even in the form of <span class="purple">simple acts of love</span> through listening to another's sorrows.</p>

        <p>And unlike others, you're not picky when it comes to who you choose to give to. It doesn't matter to you, does it? Whether it's giving to loved ones, acquaintances, and often times, <span class="purple">even strangers</span>.</p>

        <p>You might not be aware of this, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But your generosity does not go unnoticed. In fact, it <span class="purple">inspires and encourages</span> literally every one around you.</p>

        <p>And that's why the world needs more people like you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As A Caregiver, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your archetype has a magnetizing personality... One that draws respect and admiration from your friends and loved ones.</p>

        <p>It's no wonder that people are always looking towards you whenever they need a listening ear.</p>

        <p>And unlike other archetypes, you're not one to have massive circles of friends. But that does not mean to say that you have trouble with making friends, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p>In fact, it's quite the contrary. The other archetypes often find themselves drawn to your calm and tender presence.</p>

        <p>You are, however, a little bit selective when it comes to who you choose to let into your life.</p>

        <p>You prefer to keep your loved ones close, and your circle of friends small.</p>

        <p>Amongst the people who know you best, you're often seen as a <span class="purple">parental figure...</span> Someone that they look to for guidance and advice.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, this gives rise to your natural inclination to teach others, as you draw energy from <span class="purple">imparting knowledge</span> to those around you.</p>

        <p>Caregivers often find the greatest amounts of fulfillment in careers that involve a lot of teaching and guiding, and nurturing.</p>

        <p>Despite your mild-mannered character, there's a <span class="purple">fierceness</span> that resides deep within you. A fierceness that's only revealed when you have to <span class="purple">protect the people you care deeply about</span> - especially your children.</p>

        <p>You're willing to give everything and anything it takes to keep them <span class="purple">safe from harm.</span></p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is <span class="purple">Smooth-Sailing</span> For The Magnanimous Caregiver, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the <span class="purple">potential challenges</span> that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your <span class="purple">strenghts, resilience, and fortitude</span>, you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p>You see, because of your sympathetic and giving nature, your actions are highly prone to being misunderstood - misinterpreted, even.</p>

        <p>At times, others might be cynical of your good intentions. At times, they might even tarnish your reputation by spreading false rumours about you.</p>

        <p>Bullies have their eye on you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span> - cowards who have to rely on throwing their weight around to make themselves feel strong.</p>

        <p>Don't let that discourage you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. You are <span class="purple">far stronger</span> than they are, and in eventuality, you will be recognized for the <span class="purple">altruistic and giving individual</span> that you are.</p>

        <p>After all, you are the one who keeps the world grounded in sympathy and empathy, by spreading your <span class="purple">kindness and joy</span> to everyone around you.</p>

        <p>In the face of wicked hearts and selfishness, your heart of purity and kindness will prevail, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, As A Caregiver, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you tend to concern yourself with <span class="purple">acts of sharing.</span> You’re always happy to share your knowledge, wisdom and experiences with those around you. That is where you derive fulfilment from. The more you share, the more you express care for others, the happier you seem to be.</p>

        <p>However, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, that can make you <span class="purple">dependent on others</span> for your own happiness. And that is something that you need to be careful of.</p>

        <p>At times, it might feel as if you’re living your life for others. That’s not what you want, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. You want to live life for yourself. You want to love yourself. When you’re able to do that, <span class="purple">success and the life of your dreams</span> will follow. And that’s what Individuation aims to teach you.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your <span class="purple">Love Compatibility</span> With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/caregiver-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you’re not the kind of person that has trouble when it comes to love. Love interests find themselves drawn to your nurturing and giving nature.

        <p>You’re fiercely <span class="purple">loyal, patient, giving, and emotionally connected.</span> The relationships that you forge with potential lovers are always profound and deep.</p>

        <p>That being said, you tend to be very selective with who you choose to date and who you choose to end up with – for good reason, of course.</p>

        <p>You can use this little guide to determine potential life partners - especially since they're the ones who are far more aligned to your personal journey than other archetypes.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, how you perceive yourself <span class="purple">should not be determined by your love life.</span> Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
