        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Jester, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, You Are The Jester - And This Is <span class="purple">What It Means...</span></h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, before you dismiss this Archetypal Introduction as nothing but hogwash, you must know that the Jester archetype is <span class="purple">NOT one that's typically associated with naivety.</span> Truth be told, it is anything but. If you'd like to find out the truth about what the Innocent really resembles, <span class="purple">then please proceed with the rest of this Archetypal Introduction</span> with an open mind, and a willing heart.</p>

        <p>Yes, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>...  The Jester archetype is best defined by its <span class="purple">sheer positivity, enthusiasim, and optimism.</span> They'reable to interpret any situation in a perspective that's <span class="purple">hopeful, encouraging, and infectious.</span> If you're thinking that there's a lot more to the Innocent archetype than just that, you're exactly right, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>!</p>

        <p>Individuals of the Jester archetype, including you, tend to see the <span class="purple">silver lining in every cloud</span> and are constantly reminding themselves that there's virtue and a sense of goodness in everything, and every situation. You're always on the <span class="purple">lookout for wisdom and lessons</span> worth learning, no matter how painful your experiences get...</p>

        <p>To you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, everyone has a story worth listening to, every circumstance holds something worth experiencing, and everything that happens in life,  <span class="purple">happens for a reason.</span> That is a belief; a deep-rooted outlook that makes the Innocent archetype so <span class="purple">remarkable.</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/jester.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your archetype also suggests that there is a side of you that's relentless... Relentless in the sense of striving to improve yourself - whether it's your <span class="purple">physical abilities, your mental fortitude, or your emotional resilience.</span> That being said, you're certainly an individual of impressive characteristics - characteristics that are unique to your archetype.</p>

        <p>You seem to exercise selflessness in everything that you do, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... No matter how small or miniscule your actions appear to be, every decision that you make, no matter how small, is always for a <span class="purple">purpose that serves others.</span> And when it comes to making important and difficult decisions, you're <span class="purple">assertive, firm, and steadfast.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your archetype also suggests that you're <span class="purple">simple, easy-going, and transparent.</span> You're the type of person who's willing to wear your heart on your sleeve, stand up for your beliefs, and face the consequences of mistakes... An upstanding individual who's <span class="purple">fearless in profound ways.</span>

        <p>Amongst all the archetypes, you tend to have <span class="purple">the purest of intentions</span>... And that's best illustrated through the way you interact with others. Unlike others, when you claim to be happy for someone else, you actually do <span class="purple">mean it from the bottom of your heart</span> - and that goes a long way in forging valuable, close relationships.</p>

        <p>You might not like to admit it, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But when things don't turn out your way, you're easily dispappointed. That, of course, does not mean to say that your spoilt... It's that your positive outlook on everything can sometimes <span class="purple">set you up for disappointments.</span> But that's the price you have to pay for possessing such a <span class="purple">unique set of strengths,</span> <span aweber=field="name">Friend</span>.

        <p>The Innocent archetype is such a joy to be around, and I have no doubt that your friends and loved ones will agree with this. Your  <span class="purple">light-hearted and jovial nature</span> make you fun-loving, charismatic, and likeable. You try not to be seriuos most of the time, and you enjoy engaging in little things that will make <span class="purple">someone else's day brighter</span>. Whether it's pretending to laugh at a corny joke, applauding a predictable magic trick, you'd very much rather <span class="purple">bless that person</span> with positivty than put them down.</p>

        <p>And that's just a small piece of the puzzle that forms the entirety of the <span class="purple">wonderful, angelic individual</span> that you are. Unlike the archetypes who tend to struggle with hatred and anomisoty, you'd very much rather <span class="purple">make friends than enemies.</span> You're accepting, kind, and incredibly thoughtful.</p>

        <p>You might not be aware of this, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But all of these personality traits lead to so much more. Your optimism makes you <span class="purple">ferocious - like an unstoppable force.</span> There is no archetype that matches your level of determination, because there is nothing stronger than  <span class="purple">an unbreakable spirit.</span></p>

        <p>That's why the world needs more people like you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... I have no doubt that you will one day <span class="purple">infect others with your positivity</span>, and influence them to have the same tenacity as you.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As An Innocent, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are an individual who's <span class="purple">capable of finding joy in the smallest of things.</span> Your perspective of the world is through that of a childlike lens - and you experience life at the purest level. <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are most likely the motivator of any social group or work setting. You always seem to know the <span class="purple">right words to say, and at the right time.</span> You have the unique talent of <span class="purple">calming others with your presence,</span> knowing that they have someone <span class="purple">who's rooting for them</span> by their side.</p>

        <p>But that's not all there is to the Innocent archetype, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... This is merely the beginning. As an Innocent, you are <span class="purple">selfless - often putting your needs behind the needs of others.</span> You put your best in everything that you do, and you always make sure that your <span class="purple">heart's in the right place.</span></p>

        <p>There's something else about your archetype, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... You're far more magnanimous than others - always ready to  <span class="purple">give more than you're willing to receive.</span> And that stems from your <span class="purple">willingness to see the goodness in people.</span> In your eyes, all man is deserving of kindness - and that really translates through your actions.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, based on the strengths of your archetype, there is no doubt that you're an individual who makes a forgiving partner, a nurturing parent, and a dependable friend.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, it's become abundantly clear that you'll experience the <span class="purple">greatest amount of fulfillment and joy</span> from pursuing a career that will <span class="purple">allow you to motivate and bring out the best in others...</span> A noble duty that grows in greater demand as society becomes more detached and emotionally disconnectd.</p>

        <p>Beyond that, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you have a profound understanding of the <span class="purple">innerworkings of the human soul</span>. Your empathtic nature allows you to comprehend what someone else is going through, and you always seem to know how to lead them out of darkness. In many ways, you're the beacon of hope that has and will touch the lives of many.</p>

        <p>In terms of your behaviour around others, you're always ready to offer a <span class="purple">listening ear.</span> You're always swift to listen, but slow to speak. If you've ever wondered why people are always sharing their <span class="purple">deepest troubles</span> with you, that is the exact reason why, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>

        <p>You see, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span> - you exude an <span class="purple">aura of purity</span>. You trust others just as easily as others are able to place their trust in you. That's because your earnestness really shows through your personality.

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is <span class="purple">Smooth-Sailing</span> For The Virtuous Jester, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the <span class="purple">potential challenges</span> that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your <span class="purple">strenghts, resilience, and fortitude</span>, you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p>The Innocent archetype tends to struggle with <span class="purple">coming out of its comfort zone.</span> It's likely that you prefer to stay within the constrains of what you deem to be familiar. You must know, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, with your strengths and unique talents, you are definitely capable of more than you could ever imagine.</p>

        <p>You see, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, as an Innocent, it is vital for you totake up the challenge of stepping out of your comfort zone. Being surrounded with <span class="purple">unfamiliarity</span> will allow room for you, as an Innocent, to develop and improve yourself. It does not have to toe the lines of extremeities, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span> - just small, little, progressive steps.</p>

        <p>Based on the telligs of your archetype, you need to learn to take these calculated risks, whether its in social interactions or at work. </p>

        <p>Your archetype tends to be fearful of <span class="purple">consequences,</span> even though you have the capacity to power through anything that life throws at you, residing in your comfort zone for too long has made you fearful... Mistakes are part and parcel of life, and a life lived without mistakes <span class="purple">does not</span> equate to a fulfilled life.</p>

        <p>Understandably, it can be difficult for the Innocent to grow used to experiencing <span class="purple">the pain of failure.</span> And that fear in itself leads to a multitude of other challenges...</p>

        <p>You might tend to hold yourself back from <span class="purple">seizing new opportunities,</span> embarking on new ventures, or exploring unknown horizons... Things that could open doorways for you and reward you with new discoveries.</span></p>

        <p>Perhaps that might be why you concern yourself so much with the familiar, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... Because beyond the familiar, you're afraid that you'll lose your <span class="purple">self-construed identity.</span> That is perhaps, the greatest challenge that you must overcome, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span></p>

        <p>You should be constantly jumping into <span class="purple">new opportunities</span> and discovering your path as it unfolds. That way, you’ll be able to continue to grow as a person, as an individual, and as an Innocent.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, advancement and growth are not gifts that are bestowed upon you - they are the fruits of hardwork and labour. And when you take action for your personal growth, your <span class="purple">passage to fulfillment</span> will be revealed to you... All in due time.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, As A Jester, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are on a quest – a quest for happiness; for joy. And as forementioned, your archetype tends to struggle with finding fulfilment... But with this Archetypal Introduction, there is no doubt that the <span class="purple">end of the tunnel is fast approaching,</span> and you will uncover your path to fulfillment a lot sooner than expected.</p>

        <p>Based on your archetype, your <span class="purple">sheer positivity and inner fortitude</span> will form the foundation of your success - whether it's in your career, your love life, or your personal goals. And as long as you continue to act on new opportunities of personal growth, you will find the success that you’re looking for.</p>

        <p>However, as mentioned earlier in this Archetypal Introduction, your struggle with your fears tends to hold you back... Your fear of discomfort - a fear that <span class="purple">prevents you from trying different things.</span> <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you will have to keep pushing your limits before you eventually discover your <span class="purple">life’s purpose and direction.</span> And that is something that you need to work towards with your archetype.</p>

        <p>And that's where your calling resides, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. You want to live life for yourself, a life of abundance and joy.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your <span class="purple">Love Compatibility</span> With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/jester-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, the Innocent archetype is known to be <span class="purple">sweet, kind, and accepting</span> in a relationship... It's unlikely that you will encounter much difficulty with finding potential suitors.</p>

        <p>But, in this instance, it is important for you to be a little bit stringent with your criteria for a  <span class="purple">potential romantic partner.</span> After all, you have so much to offer as a lover - and you do tend to be a little bit careless with who you place your trust in. This piece of advice serves to save you another broken heart.</p>

        <p>It might take a while before you find the right one, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span> - but as the saying goes, good things come to those who wait. If you're not in a committed relationship, your best bet will be to exercise patience and caution during your search for a romantic partner.</p>

        <p>And in due time, you will <span class="purple">meet the right one</span>. However, don't be disheartened. Whether or not you're already in a committed relationship, you'll be just fine.</p>

        <p>And when, or if you already have, met the right one, you must be weary of temptations - <span class="purple">committing yourself completely</span> can be scary and hard... But with a disciplined mind and a dedicated heart, you will overcome that fear and <span class="purple">produce a fruitful and loving relationship.</span></p>

        <p>In the presence of your partner, you're not afraid of embracing who you are and <span class="purple">expressing what you feel.</span> Perhaps that stems from your honesty and willingness to trust others - especially your other half. That is a reliable indicator of a love life that is <span class="purple">healthy, easy-going, and nurturing.</span></p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, how you perceive yourself <span class="purple">should not be determined by your love life.</span> Romance is merely one, single aspect of life - not the only. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
