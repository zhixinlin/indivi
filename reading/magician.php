        <p>Dear <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>,</p>

        <p>If you’ve made it here, then congratulations! Because this means that your archetype is the Magician! But what does this actually mean? Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page. Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll <span class="purple">experience something truly magical.</span></p>

        <p>The Archetypal Identifier that you’ve recently used is designed to help you uncover your personality profile... Or, what we also know as your archetype - an in-depth examination of your entire being...</p>

        <!--Insert Archetypal Wheel Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your <span class="purple">tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</span></p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make <span class="purple">astronomical changes</span> in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>You can use it to identify and re-construct your weaknesses...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Magician, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, You Are The Magician - And This Is <span class="purple">What It Means...</span></h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, the Magician archetype is one that has forged deep connections with the universe... Amongst all the archetypes, the Magician is perhaps the <span class="purple">most difficult to comprehend,</span> and you're well aware of that. You have a strong, unbreakable belief in your <span class="purple">dreams, abilities, and yourself.</span></p>

        <p>Truth be told, the Magician archetype is not merely one-dimensional. It has many different sides and faces, and as we progress through this <span class="purple">Archetypal Introduction</span>, you'll begin to understand what I mean. But before we proceed, please do so with with an open mind, and a willing heart.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, The Magician archetype is one of <span class="purple">profound knowledge and intellect.</span> You excel when it comes to <span class="purple">deciphering patterns, breaking codes, and resolving problems.</span> Your analytical ability and logical approach to everything makes you a reliable and efficient problem solver.</p>

        <p>That, however, also means that you have tendency to be rather distant, even though you're able to recognize the most <span class="purple">intricate details about people.</span> You instinctively know who to trust, and who to look out for. Others might label you as judgmental or perhaps a little too critical, but your deductions are often, or almost alawys right.</p>

        <p>But what really sets you apart is your fearlessness and ferocity when it comes to the ideas and beliefs that you're passionate about. It’s no wonder that the people you encounter are left with a strong impression.</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/magician.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, there is a strong sense of discipline within you. Unlike other archetypes, you're not afraid of hardwork, and you're not afraid of suffering. Rather, you thrive on it. You have a strange appreciation for pain, but not in the same way as a masochist. Your appreciation for pain stems from associating it with growth and advancement - an appreciation that pushes you forward.</p>

        <p>People find themselves drawn to you because of your ability to engage in deep, thoughtful conversations. The bonds that you forge with others is often something they've never experienced before. <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>? Your deep understanding of feelings and approachable appearance makes you a <span class="purple">warm and comforting presence to be around.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, this puts you at a great advantage when it comes to <span class="purple">achieving the things that you set your mind to.</span> You're the type of person who <span class="purple">reaches for the stars</span>, and you have no intention of falling amongst the clouds.</p>

        <p>Amongst all the archetypes, the Magician is the most <span class="purple">cunning and crafty</span>... You're able to influence the decisions of others without them knowing. Your methodical when it comes to planning your steps, and you always seem to be one step ahead.</p>

        <p>You tend to make an excellent listener, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But that trait of yours comes from knowing that <span class="purple">information is power.</span> You're slow to reveal your innermost thoughts... You're a firm believer of revealing just enough, but absorbing more than you need.</p>

        <p>The Magician archetype is one that also has the tendency to become <span class="purple">manipulative and scheming.</span> For the most part, you do exercise compassion and your heart's often in the right place. But it's also important to learn to be forgiving and patience, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But we'll discuss that in greater detail as we progress through this Archetypal Introduction.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As A Magician, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are <span class="purple">intuitive, knowledgable, and versatile.</span> You have a wide variety of interests, but perhaps your greatest interest of all is <span class="purple">learning.</span></p>

        <p>But the learning in question does not refer to academics - not even close. Whether its finding out how certain things are made, or understanding why certain people are charismatic, you're just simply <span class="purple">interested to know everything.</span> That's all driven by your perpetual curiosity, and your talent in comprehending concepts quickly.</p>

        <p>There's something else about your archetype, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>...You're also incredibly versatile. You're able to assume different roles according to different situations - very much like an actual magician, who has <span class="purple">numerous tricks</span> hidden in his sleeves. Perhaps the best way to illustrate this is within a team setting - you're able to fill up whatever role is left, and you're able to do it well.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, based on the strengths of your archetype, you're an individual who's highly observant, and incredibly resourceful.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, as a Magician, you're actually a lot more <span class="purple">nurturing</span> than you think. You might appear to be a little bit emotionally detached on the outside, but when you're alone, you're actually someone who's <span class="purple">warm, caring, and tender.</span> <span class="purple"> And that translates into how well you're able to connect with others - an indicator of emotional stability.</p>

        <p>Apart from that, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you seem have a discnering understanding of what it means to love - one that adopts a more philosophical point of view, and also, one that grants you special talents when it comes to <span class="purple">empathy and affinity.</span></p>

        <p>In terms of your behaviour around others, you tend to be a little bit more reserved, especially in larger groups. But, you excel impressively in when it comes to one-on-one interactions. That's where you feel the most <span class="purple">comfortable</span>, knowing that your voice can be heard, and you can forge a <span class="purple">deeper, more personal connection.</span></p>

        <p>You see, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your aura is one that's <span class="purple">genuine and flirtatious</span>. Your laughter is infectious, and you're simply able to earn the trust of others relatively easily.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is <span class="purple">Smooth-Sailing</span> For The Romantic Magician, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the <span class="purple">potential challenges</span> that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your <span class="purple">strenghts and personality traits, </span>, you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p>The Lover archetype tends to struggle with <span class="purple">its need to be accepted.</span> And that drives you to resort to extensive measures to impress others, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. And that's also indicative of a deeper fear that resides within you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... The fear of <span class="purple">being rejected, or alone.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, as a Lover, it's likely that you feel a void deep within you... A sense of <span class="purple">emptiness or purposeless.</span> Perhaps that could be from a <span class="purple">lack of self-confidence, or a lack of self-esteem,</span> which is why you tend to place so much emphasis on your relationships with others, and tend to <span class="purple">neglect the relationship that you have with yourself.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, do not be alarmed - this is all part and parcel of what it means to be a <span class="purple">Lover</span>. And with your Archetypal Introduction, all of that will soon change.</p>

        <p>The sooner you're aware of your struggles and weaknesses, the sooner you'll be able to experience the <span class="purple">wonders and greatness</span> that it has to offer.  working on that aspect of your personality will, in fact, reveal a part of your archetype that you never knew existed.</p>

        <p>Based on your other traits, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you also seem to struggle with <span class="purple">setting yourself up for disappointments</span>. You have the tendency to expect a little too much for others, and you end up feeling dejected if your expectations are not met.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, it's important to understand that all archetypes has its fair share of <span class="purple">weaknesses and challenges</span>. Now that you're aware of them, you'll be able to pay attention to them, and then improve on them.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, As A Magician, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you’re at your happiest when you’re in a committed relationship; especially with someone who treasures you, nurtures you, and loves you for exactly who you are. Your <span class="purple">faithfulness and trust</span> are unquestionable, but if your trust is ever broken, you find it almost impossible to rebuild it.</p>

        <p>However, associating yourself too much with that one single aspect can make you <span class="purple">lost sight of who you truly are.</span> There is so much more to the Lover archetype, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. You tend to associate the successes and turmoils of your relationships with your self-worth.

        <p>However, as mentioned earlier in this Archetypal Introduction, your romantic life is not what defines you as a Lover... And in due time, you will come to understand that your <span class="purple">fears of rejection</span> are binding chains preventing you from being your true and natural self.

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you create so much value for the people around you, and the world. You have so much to offer, and your path to fulfillment rests upon the valuable connections that you forge, and your ability to spread love and joy to others.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your <span class="purple">Love Compatibility</span> With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/magician-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, the Lover archetype is known to be <span class="purple">loyal, passionate, and committed</span> in a relationship... You're giving and sacrificial - a partner than anyone would want.</p>

        <p>You're not the sort to encounter difficulties when it comes to finding romantic interests - you're <span class="purple">attractive to most,</span> and you're a wonderful person to be around.</span> You do, however, tend to be a little bit careless in your choice of partners.</p>

        <p>More often than not, your trust is betrayed and your love is taken advantage of, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. But as long as you continue to work on <span class="purple"your relationship with yourself,</span> there is no doubt that a rewarding romantic life will be waiting right around the corner for you - perhaps in the form of your current partner, or a potential suitor.</p>

        <p>In the presence of your partner, you wear your heart on your sleeve and you're not afraid to <span class="purple">ask for what you want.</span> You must, however, remember that you do tend to become a little bit <span class="purple">possessive.</span> In order to forge stronger relations with your partner, you must learn to let go and give both of you space to breathe.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, how you perceive yourself <span class="purple">should not be determined by your love life.</span> Romance is merely one, single aspect of life - not the only. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
