        <p>Dear <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>,</p>

        <p>If you’ve made it here, then congratulations! Because this means that your archetype is the Sage! But what does this actually mean? Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page. Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll <span class="purple">experience something truly magical.</span></p>

        <p>The Archetypal Identifier that you’ve recently used is designed to help you uncover your personality profile... Or, what we also know as your archetype - an in-depth examination of your entire being...</p>

        <!--Insert Archetypal Wheel Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your <span class="purple">tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</span></p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make <span class="purple">astronomical changes</span> in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>You can use it to identify and re-construct your weaknesses...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Sage, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, You Are The Sage - And This Is <span class="purple">What It Means...</span></h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, the Sage is highly dedicated when it comes to seeking two things: <span class="purple">knowledge and wisdom.</span> That's what forms the foundation of the Sage archetype - it's what it lives for, and what it thrives on.</p>
            
        <p>Practically everything that you experience in life is a lesson for you, as you're able to identify the obscure meanings behind every <span class="purple">event, occurrence, and setback.</span></p>
        
        <p>Truth be told, the Sage archetype is not merely one-dimensional. It has many different sides and faces, and as we progress through this <span class="purple">Archetypal Introduction</span>, you'll begin to understand what I mean. But before we proceed, please do so with with an open mind, and a willing heart.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, the Sage archetype is the <span class="purple">wisest of all the archetypes.</span> Your inherent wisdom is derived from your acute observations, and vast experiences of the world.</p>

        <p>This inner sense of wisdom is motivated by your curiosity of everything that life has to offer - its experiences, and its philosophies. To you, life in itself is a lifelong lesson; one that has no ceremonies or graduations - rather, a <span class="purple">perpetual cycle of learning.</span></p>

        <p>But what really sets you apart is your <span class="purple">wonder for the truth about everything.</span> You’re deeply intuitive and introspective, and you're constantly applying and <span class="purple">enriching yourself</span> throughout the course of your life.</p>
        
        <p>You keep your principles and values close to your heart, and you're an advocate of <span class="purple">mutual respect, peace, and harmony.</span></p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/sage.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, although you have the desire to attain knowledge, there are instances where you prefer to listen to your own intuition.</p> 
        
        <p>You have a profound understanding of the world, and there is a unique part that exists within you... A part that believes that <span class="purple">intuitive thinking</span> is often more reliable than logic processing.</p> 
        
        <p>It's more tha likely that you are an individual who has a deep interest in the spiritual world - an <span class="purple">intangible dimension</span> that exists beneath the layer of life.</p>
        
        <p>Others find themselves drawn to you because of your <span class="purple">wisdom, insights, and prudence.</span> This translates into your behaviour in front of others, as your words are carefully selected.</p>
        
        <p>Needless to say, the Sage is representative of a progressive world, and an enlightened life.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are certainly not one to be motivated by material possessions. You're far more interested in discovering the way to attaining <span class="purple">inner peace.</span></p> 
        
        <p>That typically stems from the realization that life is short-lived, and possessions are merely temporary.</p>

        <p>You are also an individual who enjoys reading - whether it comes in the form of books, articles, or newspapers. You're not typically interested in a single subject, but you enjoy reading things of <span class="purple">different genres, natures, and mediums.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your <span class="purple">curiosity</span> is what contributes to your vast pool of knowledge, but that is not what ultimately defines you as a Sage.</p>

        <p>What really sets the Sage apart from the rest of the archetypes is its dedication to a higher sense of self - a journey of <span class="purple">discovering experiences, and living life</span> at a level beyond the comprehension of others.</p>
            
        <p>But we'll discuss that in greater detail as we progress through this Archetypal Introduction, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As A Sage, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are <span class="purple">wise, perceptive, and incisive.</span></p> 
        
        <p>The people around you often come to you for detailed <span class="purple">advice, guidance, and direction.</span></p>

        <p>You're able to offer <span class="purple">valuable insights</span> into the situations fo others, and you're somehow able to predict the outcomes of certain situations.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, it's also because you're <span class="purple">patient and nurturing.</span> You're able to connect with the people around you at a sincere, heartfelt, and profound level.</p>
        
        <p>That's also representative of the <span class="purple">intimate connection</span> that you have with people - you're often able to read people accurately, and see them for who they truly are.</p>
            
        <p>After all, you are a <span class="purple">wise soul</span> that’s overflowing with knowledge and wisdom. People notice that about you, and that's why people are often drawn to you.</p>
        
        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, as a Sage, you're supportive and accepting of people of different backgrounds and beliefs - that trait of yours is resemblant of your <span class="purple">people-oriented</span> nature.</p>
            
        <p>Although, you do prefer to keep to yourself, and you're not always out-spoken. You are, however, more than willing to provide others with <span class="purple">answers and advice</span> when prompted.</p>
        
        <p>In more ways than one, you are an <span class="purple">investigator of truths.</span> And when you aspire to discover the truth, you always somehow manage to find it.</p> 
        
        <p>That's because you're focused on the reality of things.</p>

        <p>In terms of your behaviour around others, you are <span class="purple">composed, modest, and self-assured.</span> There is a sense of calmness that's projected through your presence.</p>
        
        <p>Although you speak few words most of the time, the words that you speak are often <span class="purple">impactful and well-informed.</span></p>
        
        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is <span class="purple">Smooth-Sailing</span> For The Wise Sage, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the <span class="purple">potential challenges</span> that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your <span class="purple">Archetypal strengths and personality traits, </span>, you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p>The Sage archetype tends to struggle with <span class="purple">procrastinating action</span> At times, your obsession with chasing truths prevents you from acting upon your inner convictions.</p>
            
        <p>That challenge arises from your focus on details - an endless pursuit that consumes too much of your time and attention</p>
        
        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, that challenge originates from a deeper fear that resides within you... and that is your fear of <span class="purple">being wrong.</span></p>
                
        <p>As a Sage, you are afraid of being misled, or feeling ignorant. And at times, that stops you from taking action, because taking action <span class="purple">makes something real.</span> And when something becomes real, you run the risk of being wrong.</p>
        
        <p>It is important for you to realize that <span class="purple">mistakes are part of being human</span> - they are unavoidable; an inevitable part of existence. But when you do learn to embrace them, you'll discover that there's so much more to learn from being active as opposed to being passive.</p> 
        
        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, do not be alarmed - this is all part and parcel of what it means to be a <span class="purple">Member</span>. And with your Archetypal Introduction, all of that will soon change.</p>

        <p>The sooner you're aware of your struggles and weaknesses, the sooner you'll be able to experience the <span class="purple">wonders and greatness</span> that it has to offer. Working on that aspect of your personality will, in fact, reveal a part of your archetype that you never knew existed.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, it's important to understand that all archetypes has its fair share of <span class="purple">weaknesses and challenges</span>. Now that you're aware of them, you'll be able to pay attention to them, and then improve on them.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, As A Sage, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you take an interest in a broad number of subjects, and your fulfilment is derived from learning. This means that you're greatest path to fulfilment can be found through a combination of engaging your mind, and translating that into motion.</p> 
        
        <p>Sages tend to excel in research-based fields, where they're able to really apply themselves. This will also allow you to tap into your <span class="purple">insatiable curiosity and passion for uncovering answers.</span></p>
        
        <p>This can be applied to both your personal and work relationships.</p>

        <p>Your calling in life will revolve primarily around those traits, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. As long as you're able to be in a position where you're able to keep your mind active and be given opportunities to execute your ideas, you will experience the <span class="purple">rewarding sense of accomplishment.</span></p>
        
        <p>However, at times, your <span class="purple">purpose and direction</span> in life might feel empty. And that is something that you need to be careful of. You might feel as if you’re living your life solely for the sake of learning, and you continue doing what you do because it’s the only thing you know how to do.</p>
        
        <p>But as long as you're constantly aspiring yourself to the truth, and pushing yourself beyond your limits, that <span class="purple">void</span> that you feel will gradually dissipate over time.</p>
        
        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your <span class="purple">Love Compatibility</span> With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/sage-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, the Sage archetype is known to be <span class="purple">perceptive, attentive, and nurturing</span> in a relationship... You're always willing to provide your romantic partner with a listening ear, and you're also emotionally available.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, it is likely that the conversations you share your romantic partner are often profound and deep. While such conversations can certainly be <span class="purple">rewarding and fascinating,</span> it's also important for you to balance that out by being <span class="purple">easy-going and less intense.</span></p>

        <p>You must bear in mind that relationships are always a two-way street, and learning to compromise and complement each other's strengths will define the success of your love life.</p>
        
        <p>The type of partner that suits you best is one that gives you a sense of <span class="purple">predictability and stability.</span> You prefer your relationships to exhibit long-term potential, with a certain level of seriousness.</p> 
        
        <p>With that being said, you must learn to be <span class="purple">humble and patient,</span> and through that, you will also learn to be a more the best partner, and the best Sage that you can be.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, how you perceive yourself <span class="purple">should not be determined by your love life.</span> Romance is merely one, single aspect of life - not the only. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
