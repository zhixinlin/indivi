        <!--Insert Archetypal Wheel Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your <span class="purple">tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</span></p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make <span class="purple">astronomical changes</span> in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>You can use it to identify and re-construct your weaknesses...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Hero, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, You Are The Hero - And This Is <span class="purple">What It Means...</span></h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your archetype suggests that you're an individual who possess <span class="purple">great mental strength, fortitude, and an unbreakable sense of perseverance.</span> You are never fearful of what the future holds for you, and you're <span class="purple">always willing to step up to challenges</span> of any sort.</p>

        <p>Yes, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... The Hero archetype is best represented through <span class="purple">the essence of sacrifice.</span> Whether it's putting the needs of others in front of your own, or simply taking the initiative to serve the greater good, you're always in the front of the line.</p>

        <p>That specific trait about you stems from your deep-seated instincts, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... Instincts that forbid you from retreating in the <span class="purple">face of adversity</span>. Instincts that prevent you from laying still in the face of injustice.</p>

        <p>While others <span class="purple">prefer to sit on the sidelines,</span> that's just not in your interests. That is also why it is often said, that the Hero has <span class="purple">no fears...</span> But let's address that in greater detail as we progress through this Archetypal Introduction.</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/hero.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your archetype also suggests that there is a side of you that's relentless... Relentless in the sense of striving to improve yourself - whether it's your <span class="purple">physical abilities, your mental fortitude, or your emotional resilience.</span> That being said, you're certainly an individual of impressive characteristics - characteristics that are unique to your archetype.</p>

        <p>You seem to exercise selflessness in everything that you do, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... No matter how small or miniscule your actions appear to be, every decision that you make, no matter how small, is always for a <span class="purple">purpose that serves others.</span> And when it comes to making important and difficult decisions, you're <span class="purple">assertive, firm, and steadfast.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your archetype also suggests that you're an individual of <span class="purple">great empathy, and a strong sense of justice.</span> You're intolerant when you encounter unfairness or corruption of any sort, and there's burning desire that drives you to want to do <span class="purple">all forms of prejudice</span>.

        <p>Your instinctive sense of righteousness is constantly pushing you <span class="purple">to be better, to do more, and to try harder</span>...

        <p>You might not like to admit it, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But from time to time, you do get worn out. After all, being a hero is certainly not a task for the weak and feeble. It can be <span class="purple">emotionally and physically draining</span> most of the time. As difficult or as impossible as it sounds, you must learn to prioritize your own <span class="purple">rejuvenation,</span> <span aweber=field="name">Friend</span>.

        <p>The Hero archetype, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, is also one that strives for greatness. You have a <span class="purple">strong vision</span> of what you want to achieve in your lifetime - a vision that few will comprehend, but many will appreciate... Your <span class="purple">compassion for your fellow man</span> is what ultimately gives you the desire to change the world.</p>

        <p>You're an individual of <span class="purple">great principles, character, and morals.</span> Unlike the archetypes who tend to struggle with temptations and might struggle differentiating between right and wrong, you always <span class="purple">have a clear idea of what is virtuous.</span></p>

        <p>You might not be aware of this, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But your willingness to step up to the plate is <span class="purple">inspiring and encouraging</span> to the people around you - strangers, friends, and loved ones. And because of this, your archetype truly has the capacity to <span class="purple">achieve greatness.</span></p>

        <p>That's why the world needs more people like you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... I have no doubt that you will one day <span class="purple">make a lasting impact on humanity</span>, and contribute great things to the world.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As A Hero, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are an individual who is <span class="purple">incredibly grounded.</span> You possess the unique ability to discern right from wrong, and you’re never afraid to put your foot down. You have a great deal to offer to this world. <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you have a number of leadership qualities... Especially since you're someone who's <span class="purple">self-aware, decisive, and somewhat stern.</span> People find themselves <span class="purple">calmed by your presence,</span> knowing that they have someone <span class="purple">reliable and dependable</span> by their side.</p>

        <p>But that's not all there is to the Hero archetype, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... This is merely the beginning. As a Hero, you are  <span class="purple">extremely protective of your loved ones.</span> You're not the most expressive person on the planet, but each of your loved ones holds a special place in your heart. You might a little bit too protective at times, but it definitely comes from a good place.</p>

        <p>There's something else about your archetype, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... You're a lot more domestic than the other archetypes. Your home is your place of rest - a peaceful haven that you retire to at the end of each day - and also, a place where you're <span class="purple">deeply emotionally attached to.</span> And that stems from your <span class="purple">sense of loyalty.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, based on the strengths of your archetype, there is no doubt that you're an individual who makes a protective partner, a caring parent, and a trustworthy friend.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, it's become abundantly clear that you'll experience the <span class="purple">greatest amount of fulfillment and joy</span> from pursuing a career that will <span class="purple">allow you to make difficult decisions, and give you a strong sense of duty...</span></p>

        <p>Beyond that, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you tend to perceive circumstances as either  <span class="purple">black or white</span>, with no gray in between. That particular trait might not sound all that positive, but it's one of the greatest factors that makes you such an <span class="purple">effective decision maker.</span></p>

        <p>In terms of your behaviour around friends and family, you tend to adopt a more <span class="purple">serious, no nonsense type of front.</span> If a conversation does not produce value, then you'd rather not engage in it. You're not the type of person to clown around - you'd very much prefer to invest your time and energy into <span class="purple">productive</span> tasks instead of looking like a fool.</p>

        <p>You see, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span> - you have a rather <span class="purple">intense aura</span>. That does not mean to say that it's a bad thing - after all, when it comes to getting things done, you'll always be on the top of everyone's lists, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p>And yet, all is fair in the realm of Archetypes - where weaknesses can at times be strengths, and likewise, strengths too can quickly turn into weaknesses. And that applies to your archetype of the Hero as well, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is <span class="purple">Smooth-Sailing</span> For The Courageous Hero, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the <span class="purple">potential challenges</span> that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your <span class="purple">strengths, resilience, and fortitude</span>, you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p>You see, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, despite your brave frontier, there are fears that reside within your archetype... Deep-seated fears that appear miniscule to others, but appear menacing to you.</p>

        <p>Your archetype tends to be fearful of <span class="purple">having others perceive you incorrectly,</span> or even misjudged. Your archetype tends to concern itself with its image... Constantly wondering about what others think of you, whether or not they take a liking to you...

        <p>An unhealthy obsession that prevents you from <span class="purple">embarking on something new,</span> or trying something that you've never tried before. You're usually fearful of becoming the <span class="purple">object of ridicule or laughter...</span> That stems from your fear that the strong, dependable impression that you've worked so hard to portray will crumble.</p>

        <p>Deep inside your archetype, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, beneath the bravado and seriousness, is a small part of you that just wants to be <span class="purple">accepted and loved.</span></p>

        <p>Perhaps that might be why you concern yourself so much with appearances, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... Because without appearances, you're afraid that you'll lose your <span class="purple">self-construed identity.</span> That is perhaps, the greatest challenge that you must overcome, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span></p>

        <p>As a Hero, you have the tendency to be a little too critical about yourself - constantly <span class="purple">pushing yourself</span> to achieve new heights, gain new experiences, and explore everywhere that you've never been before. But, at the same time, you must understand that <span class="purple">growth takes time</span>. You might not have all the time in the world, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, but it is paramount for you to <span class="purple">exercise patience</span> in order not to wear yourself out.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, advancement and growth are products of both time and effort, and when you implement that to become a part of your life, your <span class="purple">passage to fulfillment</span> will be revealed to you... All in due time.</p>

        <p>There's something else you need to be aware of, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p>Although you tend to project yourself as someone serious, assertive, and seemingly hard to work with, you're an excellent team player - perhaps amongst the best of all the archetypes. You're both <span class="purple">reliable and trusting,</span> and that balance translates into the way you work with others. You're willing to be diligent and to step up to the tasks that you'r not familiar with, and you always find a solution.</p>

        <p>After all, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, this is the Hero's motto... <span class="purple">When there's a will, there's a way.</span> And that saying really shines through your actions and behaviour, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, As A Hero, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, ultimately, you are <span class="purple">a realist</span> – someone who sets and achieves realistic goals. You're not comfortable with being wishy-washy or fickle-minded. When you've set your mind to something, you'll do everything it takes to make it happen.</p>

        <p>Based on your archetype, it's apparent that you have a <span class="purple">strong sense of ambition</span> - a sense of hunger to do greater things.</p>

        <p>However, as mentioned earlier in this Archetypal Introduction, your struggle with your identity tends to hold you back... Your fear of looking silly - a fear that <span class="purple">prevents you from trying different things.</span> <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you will have to keep pushing your limits before you eventually discover your <span class="purple">life’s purpose and direction.</span> And that is something that you need to work towards with your archetype.</p>

        <p>And that's where your calling resides, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. You want to live life for yourself, without limits. You want to be recognized and respected for who you are, while learning to be more bold with your impression.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your <span class="purple">Love Compatibility</span> With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/hero-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, the Hero archetype is a <span class="purple">giving, faithful, and dependable lover.</span> The ideal, dream-like partner who appears to be textbook-perfect.</p>

        <p>It's difficult to describe, but this is the most apt way of putting it. Based on the nature of your archetype, you tend to be an <span class="purple">excellent life partner</span>, but you tend to struggle with recognizing the right partners for you.</p>

        <p>It might take a while before you find the right one, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span> - but as the saying goes, good things come to those who wait. If you're not in a committed relationship, your best bet will be to exercise patience and caution during your search for a romantic partner.</p>

        <p>And in due time, you will <span class="purple">meet the right one</span>. However, don't be disheartened. Whether or not you're already in a committed relationship, you'll be just fine.</p>

        <p>And when, or if you already have, met the right one, you must be weary of temptations - <span class="purple">committing yourself completely</span> can be scary and hard... But with a disciplined mind and a dedicated heart, you will overcome that fear and <span class="purple">produce a fruitful and loving relationship.</span></p>

        <p>In the presence of your partner, depending on your level of comfort, you tend to be slightly more reserved than usual...</span> Perhaps that stems from your struggle with how others perceive you - especially your romantic interest. However, as cliche as it sounds, you must remember that it's important to <span class="purple">be yourself,</span> and when you do, you will also be accepted for who you are.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, how you perceive yourself <span class="purple">should not be determined by your love life.</span> Romance is merely one, single aspect of life - not the only. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
