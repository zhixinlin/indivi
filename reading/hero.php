        <p>Dear <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>,</p>

Don’t worry, everything you need to know will be on this page. Stick to the end of it and I promise that you’ll <span class="purple">experience something truly magical.</span></p>

        <!--Insert Archetypal Wheel Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your <span class="purple">tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</span></p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make <span class="purple">astronomical changes</span> in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>You can use it to identify and re-construct your weaknesses...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Hero, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, You Are The Hero - And This Is <span class="purple">What It Means...</span></h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your archetype suggests that you're an individual who possess <span class="purple">great mental strength, fortitude, and an unbreakable sense of perseverance.</span> You are never fearful of what the future holds for you, and you're <span class="purple">always willing to step up to challenges</span> of any sort.</p>

        <p>Yes, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... The Hero archetype is best represented through <span class="purple">the essence of sacrifice.</span> Whether it's putting the needs of others in front of your own, or simply taking the initiative to serve the greater good, you're always in the front of the line.</p>

        <p>That specific trait about you stems from your deep-seated instincts, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... Instincts that forbid you from retreating in the <span class="purple">face of adversity</span>. Instincts that prevent you from laying still in the face of injustice.</p>

        <p>While others <span class="purple">prefer to sit on the sidelines,</span> that's just not in your interests. That is also why it is often said, that the Hero has <span class="purple">no fears...</span> But let's address that in greater detail as we progress through this Archetypal Introduction.</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/hero.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your archetype also suggests that there is a side of you that's relentless... Relentless in the sense of striving to improve yourself - whether it's your <span class="purple">physical abilities, your mental fortitude, or your emotional resilience.</span> That being said, you're certainly an individual of impressive characteristics - characteristics that are unique to your archetype.</p>

        <p>You seem to exercise selflessness in everything that you do, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... No matter how small or miniscule your actions appear to be, every decision that you make, no matter how small, is always for a <span class="purple">purpose that serves others.</span> And when it comes to making important and difficult decisions, you're <span class="purple">assertive, firm, and steadfast.</p>

          <!---BOOKMARK-->


        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your archetype also suggests that you're often on the lookout for opportunities that don't necessarily take you out of the country. As long as there's a new experience waiting for you, you're <span class="purple">more than willing to give it a shot.</span> Whether it's an activity, a sport, or even a new restaurant that you've never tried before - <span class="purple">you're always game.</span></p>

        <p>You might not like to admit it, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But you're charismatic - at least, more so than the other archetypes. This trait of yours stems from your <span class="purple">willingness to step out of your comfort zone</span> - a trait that's also indicative of your willingness to look silly. And there is nothing more charismatic than someone who <span class="purple">possesses that amount of self-confidence.</span></p>

        <p>The Explorer archetype, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, is also one that strives to be different. You prefer to feel and immerse yourself in the most <span class="purple">foreign environments</span> - environments that the other archetypes would prefer to avoid. There's also a side of you that tends to be a little bit of an <span class="purple">adrenaline junkie</span> - it might not be all that obvious, but it definitely exists.</p>

        <p>You're an individual who's<span class="purple">sociable, likeable, and approachable.</span> Unlike the archetypes who are more introverted by nature, any day that you spend <span class="purple">sitting around at home feels like a waste of your time.</span> You'd very much prefer to <span class="purple">be literally anywhere else, doing anything else,</span> instead of being cooped up and alone.</p>

        <p>You might not be aware of this, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But your willingness to try new things is <span class="purple">inspiring and encouraging</span> to the people around you - mostly your peers. And because of this, your archetype truly has the capacity to <span class="purple">achieve greatness.</span></p>

        <p>That's why the world needs more people like you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... I have no doubt that you will one day <span class="purple">uncover ground-breaking discoveries,</span> and contribute great things to the world.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As A Hero, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, despite often being the center of attention, your incessant curiosity about others makes you an individual who's <span class="purple">self-aware and emotionally connected to others.</span> That's because even though people are more than willing to listen to the stories that you share and the images that you portray, <span class="purple">you always know when it's time to shift the limelight to someone else.</span> And that realization is often driven by you wanting to know the <span class="purple">stories of others.</span></p>

        <p>All of that gives rise to the one single attribute that truly resembles the Explorer archetype - your <span class="purple">obsession with experience</span> - an obsession that drives you to <span class="purple">learn, to discover, and to explore.</span></p>

        <p>There's something else about your archetype, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... And you might or might not agree with this... Your archetype, because of your worldly knowledge and self-motivated curiosity, possesses a <span class="purple">deep understanding of human nature and culture.</span> You're likely to be someone who reads people rather well. You know who you can <span class="purple">trust</span>, and who you must <span class="purple">avoid</span> at all costs. </p>

        <p>Although, there are times when compassion takes control over your tendencies, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... And that's when you become vulnerable to having your <span class="purple">trust misplaced</span> and taken advantage of.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p>Based on those attributes, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, it's evident that you'll experience the <span class="purple">greatest amount of fulfillment and joy</span> from pursuing a career that will <span class="purple">feed your curiosity</span>, take you outside of the typical confinements of a desk space, and constantly keep you on your toes... Perhaps something outdoors-ish or travel-related.</p>

        <p>Beyond that, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you're also someone who's open-minded. You're very accepting of people who come from <span class="purple">different backgrounds.</span> Your experience with <span class="purple">foreign cultures and environments</span> has exposed you to a variety of circumstances and perspectives, and you're always reminding yourself to be respectful of that.</p>

        <p>That's also because you tend to enjoy things that are a bit <span class="purple">out of the ordinary and venturing out into the unknown</span> - things that individuals belonging to other archetypes would prefer to avoid.</p>

        <p>You see, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span> - you have a rather <span class="purple">valiant aura</span>, and a daring approach. You're not one to follow in the footsteps of others, are you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. Instead, you're the one who paves the way forward - bashing through the bushes like the gallant discoverer that you are. After all, you have to be <span class="purple">a little bit bold</span> in other to explore the unexplored, wouldn't you agree, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>?</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is <span class="purple">Smooth-Sailing</span> For The Courageous Hero, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the <span class="purple">potential challenges</span> that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your <span class="purple">strenghts, resilience, and fortitude</span>, you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p>You see, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, despite your brave frontier, there are fears that reside within your archetype... Deep-seated fears that appear miniscule to others, but appear menacing to you.</p>

        <p>Your archetype tends to be fearful of <span class="purple">commitment,</span> and even anything that resembles it. <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... It's  likely that at a certain point in your life, you found the idea of marriage a little bit alien - an idea that just <span class="purple">never made sense to you.</span> That attribute stems from your fear of commitment; commitment of any sort... Whether it's residing in a single place for too long, or remaining in a relationship with one, single person for eternity.</p>

        <p>Of course, there's nothing wrong with being alone, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But that fear originates from your obsession with new experiences - an obsession that often leads you to <span class="purple">neglect the people closest to you.</span></p>

        <p>Don't let that discourage you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. As long as you're <span class="purple">watchful over how your actions affect others,</span> you will be able to avoid making that mistake.</p>

        <p>As an Explorer, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you have the tendency to be a little too critical about yourself - constantly <span class="purple">pushing yourself</span> to achieve new heights, gain new experiences, and explore everywhere that you've never been before. But, at the same time, you must understand that <span class="purple">growth takes time</span>. You might not have all the time in the world, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, but it is paramount for you to <span class="purple">exercise patience</span> in order not to wear yourself out.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, advancement and growth are products of both time and effort, and when you implement that to become a part of your life, your <span class="purple">passage to fulfillment</span> will be revealed to you... All in due time.</p>

        <p>There's something else you need to be aware of, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p>In spite of your magnetic personality, you tend to prefer working on your own - and that trait in itself sets boundaries that can prevent you from achieving greater things. It is vital for you to <span class="purple">learn to trust others</span>, and by doing so, you will find that there's a lot <span class="purple">more for you to gain</span> than to lose.</p>

        <p>To maximize the abilities of your archetype, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you must <span class="purple">always be trusting, always be humble, and always be giving.</span> Those are the qualities and lessons that will lead you to your <span class="purple">eventual success.</span></p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, As A Hero, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are practically <span class="purple">a chameleon</span> – possessing the uncanny ability to make yourself at home within any social group, or social setting; no matter how foreign. Your charisma and eloquence intrigues people. And at times, it also earns their trust.</p>

        <p>Based on your archetype, it's apparent that you have a <span class="purple">strong sense of ambition</span> - a sense of hunger to do greater things.</p>

        <p>However, as mentioned earlier in this Archetypal Introduction, your struggle with commitment tends to hold you back. You tend to associate commitment with the feeling of <span class="purple">being trapped and having your freedom stripped away from you...</span> But that feeling could not be further from the truth, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. Fulfilment, at its essence, is derived from forging valuable relationships – with others, and yourself. And that, in itself, requires commitment.</p>

        <p>And that's where your calling resides, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. You want to live life for yourself, without appearing selfish. You want to love yourself, while keeping the relationships you’ve forged <span class="purple">close to your heart.</span> Your archetype is the <span class="purple">role model and catalyst of change</span>, with exploration as its backbone.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your <span class="purple">Love Compatibility</span> With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/hero-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your love compatibility profile is extraordinarily different from the other archetypes - and I'm sure some of your exes or current partner will agree with me on this.</p>

        <p>It's difficult to describe, but this is the most apt way of putting it. Based on the nature of your archetype, you tend to be an <span class="purple">excellent short-term lover</span>, but you might find it difficult to be a long-term partner.</p>

        <p>Your relationships and romances are often short-lived. Even if the connection between you and your romantic partner appears strong, you always seem to have one foot out the door.</p>

        <p>Because of that, it can be challenging for you to <span class="purple">meet the right one</span>. However, don't be disheartened. Whether or not you're already in a committed relationship, you'll be just fine.</p>

        <p>And when, or if you already have, met the right one, you must be weary of temptations - <span class="purple">committing yourself completely</span> can be scary and hard... But with a disciplined mind and a dedicated heart, you will overcome that fear and <span class="purple">produce a fruitful and loving relationship.</span></p>

        <p>In the presence of your partner, depending on your level of comfort, you tend to be slightly more reserved than usual...</span> Perhaps that stems from your struggle with trust. However, you must remember that it's trust that will allow your archetype to open up.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, how you perceive yourself <span class="purple">should not be determined by your love life.</span> Romance is merely one, single aspect of life - not the only. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
