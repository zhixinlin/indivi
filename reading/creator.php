        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your <span class="purple">tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</span></p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make <span class="purple">astronomical changes</span> in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Creator, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, You Are The Creator - And This Is <span class="purple">What It Means...</span></h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are an individual who posseses a stupendous amount of creativity... An individual whose <span class="purple">sole purpose</span> is to express yourself through your idealistic and innovative mind.</p>

        <p>That being said, you truly are a unique individual, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... And needless to say, the world certainly needs more people like you.</p>

        <p>You're someone who's also incredibly <span class="purple">resourceful, scrappy, and imaginative...</span> Finding all sorts of ways to express your ideas and feelings. Because of this, you're also somoene who's well-respected by the others around you - for your talents and abilities in the things, hobbies, and skills that you're passionate about.</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/creator.png">

        <p>...Your archetype also suggests that you're highly opinionated, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... You take <span class="purple">great pride</span> in your work - your craft. It's what you live for, and also what you're willing to sacrifice for.</p>

        <p>You hold high regards for your originality, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... It is highly representative of you to refuse to conform to societal expectations. You're often <span class="purple">challenging the norm</span> - battling against conventional rules.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your archetype also suggests that you're often on the lookout for opportunities to showcase your talents. After all, the <span class="purple">admiration and respect</span> that you receive can feel rather rewarding, doesn't it?</p>

        <p>You might not like to admit it, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But you're gifted - at least, more so than the other archetypes. You pour your heart, mind, and soul into anything that you construct, ensuring that the outcomes resembles the <span class="purple">closest thing possible to perfection.</span></p>

        <p>The Creator archetype, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, is also one that seems to enjoy working with its hands. You prefer to immerse yourself in the <span class="purple">tangible experience</span> of what it means to create. The lesser the medium, the closer you feel to your work.</p>

        <p>And unlike others, you're not exactly the most<span class="purple">sociable person on the planet...</span> On a bright Sunday afternoon, you'd very much prefer to remain in the comfort of your own home - <span class="purple">honing your talents and improving yourself</span> instead of being out shopping or spending time with your friends.</p>

        <p>You might not be aware of this, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But your creativity is <span class="purple">inspiring and encouraging</span> to the people around you - mostly your peers. And because of this, your archetype truly has the capacity to <span class="purple">achieve greatness.</span></p>

        <p>That's why the world needs more people like you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... I have no doubt that you will one day <span class="purple">uncover ground-breaking solutions,</span> and contribute great things to the world.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As A Creator, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, although you tend to be rather aloof in the conversations that you share with others, you do also seem to enjoy the occasional chit-chat. That's because you've <span class="purple">constructed thick barriers</span> between you and the rest of the world - but unfortunately, it can get a little at times...</p>

        <p>That's why you're more than elated whenever someone comes to you for a listening ear.</p>

        <p>That's also explains your introspective tendencies - especially when you're on your own. It's not unusual for <span class="purple">philosphical thoughts</span> to cross your mind ever so often. You seem to <span class="purple">draw energy from being by yourself, and expending energy when you're surrounded by others.</span></p>

        <p>Although, that does not hinder you one bit, doesn't it, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>? After all, you do possess the confidence to do things on your own, and you certainly have the composure and poise to pull it off.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p>Based on those attributes, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, it's evident that you'll experience the <span class="purple">greatest amount of fulfillment and joy</span> from pursuing a career as an artist, a designer, a writer, a creative director, or pretty much anything that taps into your out-of-the-box thinking.</p>

        <p>Beyond that, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you're also someone who's open-minded. You're very accepting of people who come from <span class="purple">different backgrounds.</span> You have the sense to realize that different perspectives exist, and you're always reminding yourself to be respectful of that.</p>

        <p>That's also because you tend to enjoy things that are a bit <span class="purple">out of the ordinary and venturing out into the unknown</span> - things that individuals belonging to other archetypes rarely think about.</p>

        <p>You see, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span> - you have a rather <span class="purple">quirky personality</span>, and a diverse set of interests. But those are the little oddities that make you who you are, wouldn'y you agree?</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is <span class="purple">Smooth-Sailing</span> For The Inventive Creator, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the <span class="purple">potential challenges</span> that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your <span class="purple">strengths, resilience, and fortitude</span>, you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p>You see, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, there are fears that reside within your archetype... Deep-seated fears that appear miniscule to others, but appear menacing to you.</p>

        <p>Your archetype tends to be fearful of <span class="purple">appearing unoriginal, or even mediocre.</span> And this stems from one thing, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... It stems from the concern that you have of how others perceive you.</p>

        <p>Although you're always telling yourself not to care, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, there's a part of you that struggles to let go. And even though you manage to successfuly convince yourself some times, you eventually fall back into the same patterns and same routines.</p>

        <p>Don't let that discourage you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. You possess <span class="purple">a strong source of inner strength...</span>  And your fears are certainly far more profound than the fears of others. Society has evolved into a <span class="purple">platform of judgments</span> - people judge, and are therefore afraid of being judged. And the sooner you recognize that, the sooner you'll be able to <span class="purple">step out of that domain.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you must also be careful of your own perfectionism. That's the strange thing about your archetype - what you're good at can also be your worst enemy.</p>

        <p>After all, too much of a good thing is a bad thing, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p>Your unhealthy obsession with perfectionism can <span class="purple">stop you from even trying</span> in the first place. And there is no greater failure than preventing yourself from failing.</p>

        <p>To maximize the abilities of your archetype, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you must <span class="purple">always be trying, always be experimenting, and always be failing.</span> As ironic as it sounds, that is the journey that will lead you to your <span class="purple">eventual success.</span></p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, As A Creator, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are the <span class="purple">epitome of expression</span> – possessing the uncanny ability to communicate your emotions in the most creative, yet accurate ways. You excel at one-on-one interactions, and never fail to make an excellent impression on others. Your unique thinking and intelligence intrigues people.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are an executor. You have a <span class="purple">clear vision</span> of what you want to achieve. And as soon as you've set your mind to it, you can consider it done.</p>

        <p>Your brilliant mind <span class="purple">crafts and generates ideas</span> at the speed of light, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, with each idea having more clarity, and more purpose than the last. That's your perceived <span class="purple">path to fulfillment,</span> <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span> - seeing your ideas to fruition.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your <span class="purple">Love Compatibility</span> With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/creator-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you tend to be slightly neglectful as a lover - and I'm sure some of your exes or current partner will agree with me on this.</p>

        <p>That's because your mind is constantly scattered and spread out across an array of thoughts - and although you're physically present, your physical presence in presented with <span class="purple">emotional absence.</span>

        <p>However, that's just who you are, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. And any understanding, respectful lover will accept you for exactly the way that you are.</p>

        <p>Despite all of that, you're <span class="purple">intensely committed to your partner</span> - it's unlike you to have your heart stray, unless the circumstances of your relationship toe the lines of extemities.</p>

        <p>In the presence of your partner, you seem to be chirpier - more jovial, and more open. That's because <span class="purple">trust is extremely important to you,</span> because it's trust that will allow your archetype to open up.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, how you perceive yourself <span class="purple">should not be determined by your love life.</span> Your spouse or partner is meant to play a supporting role in your life; not the lead. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
