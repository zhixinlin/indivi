        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Lover, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, You Are The Lover - And This Is <span class="purple">What It Means...</span></h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, the Lover archetype is one that comprises a series of <span class="purple">interesting traits and generous attributes.</span> Truth be told, the Lover archetype is not merely one-dimensional. It has many different sides and faces, and as we progress through this <span class="purple">Archetypal Introduction</span>, you'll begin to understand what I mean. But before we proceed, please do so with with an open mind, and a willing heart.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, The Lover archetype is one of <span class="purple">profound sensitivity, and deep emotional connection.</span> That means that you are an individual who <span class="purple">experiences the extremities of all emotions.</span> Your happiness is often an elation beyond description, while your pain feels like it can be excruciating and crippling...</p>

        <p>That stems from your ability to understand and experience life at heightened levels. Because of that profound connection that you share with feeling and sentiments, you have an extraordinary ability when it comes to <span class="purple">reading people</span> - that includes recognizing their emotions, understanding their circumstances, and being able to see right through their expressions.</p>

        <p>You have <span class="purple">an edge</span> over everyone else when it comes to navigating your way through social situations. It’s no wonder that the people you encounter always feel so drawn to you.</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/lover.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your archetype revolves vastly around emotions, feelings, and sensuality. You have no qualms when it comes to opening up to others. In fact, you're even more than happy to do so. Unlike other archetypes, the Lover is capable of experiencing life in a much <span class="purple">richer and concentrated</span> fashion. You appreciate the littlest of things and you're able to understand the underlying meanings of actions.</p>

        <p>People find themselves drawn to you because of your ability to engage in deep, thoughtful conversations. The bonds that you forge with others is often something they've never experienced before. <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>? Your deep understanding of feelings and approachable appearance makes you a <span class="purple">warm and comforting presence to be around.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your archetype also suggests that you're <span class="purple">soft-hearted, gentle, and mellow.</span> You're the type of person who  <span class="purple">reaches out to the quitest person in the room</span>, trying your best to make everyone feel comfortable.</p>

        <p>Amongst all the archetypes, yours has the greatest tendency to <span class="purple">romanticizie things</span>... Whether it's your relationships, Not that it's a bad thing, of course. It's just a part of who you are. You're expressive as a person, and you're undivded with your attention.</p>

        <p>You tend to make an excellent listener, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... Unlike other archetypes, you never struggle when it comes to exercising empathy and understanding the emotions and feelings of others. That's because you seem to be slightly more introverted based on your nature.</p>

        <p>The Lover archetype is one that's deeply committed to the things and people that it cares about. You're always willing to <span class="purple">go out of your way, and above and beyond </span>to make someone feel special and appreciated. And as you might have already guessed by now, even though you draw energy from being by yourself, you're a lot more people-oriented that you think, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As A Lover, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are an individual who's <span class="purple">sensual, affectionate, and benevolent.</span> Although you prefer to keep your circle of friends small, you invest a lot of time and attention into the relationships that you forge. People who cross paths with you often have a memorable impression, primarily because of your <span class="purple">welcoming and pleasant demeanour.</span> </p>

        <p>Your archetype also suggests that you're someone who's protective, whether it comes to your <span class="purple">relationships or possessions.</span> Anything that belongs to you is often kept in good condition, and that translates into your friendships and relationships as well.</p>

        <p>There's something else about your archetype, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... Nothing pleases you more than <span class="purple">expressing love, and receiving love.</span> Although, the type of love in question does not necessarily solely refer to <span class="purple">romance or courtship.</span> It also includes love between friends, family, and even strangers.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, based on the strengths of your archetype, you're an individual who's appreciative of the little things in life, making your positive presence both contagious and addictive.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, as a Lover, you center your life around one thing - <span class="purple">love.</span> Your archetype's greatest obsession involves a combination of <span class="purple"> intimacy, and experience...</span> <span class="purple"> An outlook on life that motivates you to develop yourself in terms of <span class="purple">emotional maturity.</span></p>

        <p>Apart from that, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you seem have a discnering understanding of what it means to love - one that adopts a more philosophical point of view, and also, one that grants you special talents when it comes to <span class="purple">empathy and affinity.</span></p>

        <p>In terms of your behaviour around others, you tend to be a little bit more reserved, especially in larger groups. But, you excel impressively in when it comes to one-on-one interactions. That's where you feel the most <span class="purple">comfortable</span>, knowing that your voice can be heard, and you can forge a <span class="purple">deeper, more personal connection.</span></p>

        <p>You see, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your aura is one that's <span class="purple">genuine and flirtatious</span>. Your laughter is infectious, and you're simply able to earn the trust of others relatively easily.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is <span class="purple">Smooth-Sailing</span> For The Romantic Lover, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the <span class="purple">potential challenges</span> that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your <span class="purple">strengths and personality traits, </span>, you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p>The Lover archetype tends to struggle with <span class="purple">its need to be accepted.</span> And that drives you to resort to extensive measures to impress others, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. And that's also indicative of a deeper fear that resides within you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... The fear of <span class="purple">being rejected, or alone.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, as a Lover, it's likely that you feel a void deep within you... A sense of <span class="purple">emptiness or purposeless.</span> Perhaps that could be from a <span class="purple">lack of self-confidence, or a lack of self-esteem,</span> which is why you tend to place so much emphasis on your relationships with others, and tend to <span class="purple">neglect the relationship that you have with yourself.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, do not be alarmed - this is all part and parcel of what it means to be a <span class="purple">Lover</span>. And with your Archetypal Introduction, all of that will soon change.</p>

        <p>The sooner you're aware of your struggles and weaknesses, the sooner you'll be able to experience the <span class="purple">wonders and greatness</span> that it has to offer. Working on that aspect of your personality will, in fact, reveal a part of your archetype that you never knew existed.</p>

        <p>Based on your other traits, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you also seem to struggle with <span class="purple">setting yourself up for disappointments</span>. You have the tendency to expect a little too much for others, and you end up feeling dejected if your expectations are not met.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, it's important to understand that all archetypes has its fair share of <span class="purple">weaknesses and challenges</span>. Now that you're aware of them, you'll be able to pay attention to them, and then improve on them.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, As A Lover, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you’re at your happiest when you’re in a committed relationship; especially with someone who treasures you, nurtures you, and loves you for exactly who you are. Your <span class="purple">faithfulness and trust</span> are unquestionable, but if your trust is ever broken, you find it almost impossible to rebuild it.</p>

        <p>However, associating yourself too much with that one single aspect can make you <span class="purple">lost sight of who you truly are.</span> There is so much more to the Lover archetype, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. You tend to associate the successes and turmoils of your relationships with your self-worth.

        <p>However, as mentioned earlier in this Archetypal Introduction, your romantic life is not what defines you as a Lover... And in due time, you will come to understand that your <span class="purple">fears of rejection</span> are binding chains preventing you from being your true and natural self.

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you create so much value for the people around you, and the world. You have so much to offer, and your path to fulfillment rests upon the valuable connections that you forge, and your ability to spread love and joy to others.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your <span class="purple">Love Compatibility</span> With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/lover-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, the Lover archetype is known to be <span class="purple">loyal, passionate, and committed</span> in a relationship... You're giving and sacrificial - a partner than anyone would want.</p>

        <p>You're not the sort to encounter difficulties when it comes to finding romantic interests - you're <span class="purple">attractive to most,</span> and you're a wonderful person to be around.</span> You do, however, tend to be a little bit careless in your choice of partners.</p>

        <p>More often than not, your trust is betrayed and your love is taken advantage of, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. But as long as you continue to work on <span class="purple"your relationship with yourself,</span> there is no doubt that a rewarding romantic life will be waiting right around the corner for you - perhaps in the form of your current partner, or a potential suitor.</p>

        <p>In the presence of your partner, you wear your heart on your sleeve and you're not afraid to <span class="purple">ask for what you want.</span> You must, however, remember that you do tend to become a little bit <span class="purple">possessive.</span> In order to forge stronger relations with your partner, you must learn to let go and give both of you space to breathe.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, how you perceive yourself <span class="purple">should not be determined by your love life.</span> Romance is merely one, single aspect of life - not the only. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
