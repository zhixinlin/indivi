        <!--Insert Archetypal Wheel Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your <span class="purple">tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</span></p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make <span class="purple">astronomical changes</span> in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>You can use it to identify and re-construct your weaknesses...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Ruler, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, You Are The Ruler - And This Is <span class="purple">What It Means...</span></h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, the Ruler archetype is best defined by its <span class="purple">innate ability to lead.</span> While others tend to avoid playing the role of a leader, Rulers are absolutely comfortable with <span class="purple">volunteering to take charge.</span></p>
            
        <p>It's important to note that it's not the desire to lead that defines the Ruler archetype, but the actual quality of leadership that you are able to administer.</p>
        
        <p>Truth be told, the Ruler archetype is not merely one-dimensional. It has many different sides and faces, and as we progress through this <span class="purple">Archetypal Introduction</span>, you'll begin to understand what I mean. But before we proceed, please do so with with an open mind, and a willing heart.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, the Ruler archetype is best illustrated through the decisions that you make. You are often <span class="purple">fair, just, and honourable.</span></p>

        <p>You're able to <span class="purple">manage the expectations of others</span> and grant direction towards <span class="purple">maintaining order</span> amongst your friends and various groups of people.</p>

        <p>But what really sets you apart is your <span class="purple">passion for power and authority...</span> Control is the one thing that you sought after the most, and also the one thing that you find the most fulfilling.</p>
        
        <p>Everything that you do is always somehow related to either <span class="purple">gaining, maintaining, or even exercising control.</span></p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/ruler.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, that does not mean to say that you're a control freak. Your approach to idea of control is <span class="purple">calculated and methodical.</span></p> 
        
        <p>More often than not, you leverage on your leadership qualities to attain <span class="purple">higher personal goals,</span> be it for their family, friends, or your community 0 and not for senseless or selfish reasons.</p> 
        
        <p>If there's anyone who's capable of pulling that off, it's you, and you know that as well.</p>
        
        <p>Others find themselves drawn to you because of your <span class="purple">assertive and decisive personality.</span>  Within your group of friends, you are often the one calling the shots and organizing outings and gatherings... A trait that others find alluring and attractive about you.</p>
        
        <p>Needless to say, the Ruler is perhaps one of the most charismatic archetypes, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. After all, you do need a little bit of charisma in order to gain the trust of others.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are also idealistic when it comes to your goals - a strong sign of a visionary. You refuse to fall short of your objectives, and you consider <span class="purple">consolation as an indicator of failure.</span></p> 
        
        <p>As a Ruler, you thrive on creating <span class="purple">reliable systems for others to follow</span>.</p>

        <p>Your stance is grounded with conviction, and that conviction is articulated with <span class="purple">empathy, kindness, and a giving heart.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, your visions are what drive you and motivate you to live life to its fullest. And you refuse to rest until you see your visions through.</p>

        <p>You feel responsible for the others around you - whether they're your friends, co-workers, or even your loved ones. That sense of responsibility pushes you to <span class="purple">lead them by example.</span> And that's what ultimately separates you from the wannabes.</p>
            
        <p>But we'll discuss that in greater detail as we progress through this Archetypal Introduction, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As A Ruler, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are <span class="purple">inspiring, confident, and determined.</span></p> 
        
        <p>You might not have a specific expertise or an actual skill set, but as a generalist, you do possess excellent management abilities.</p>

        <p>You're able to delegate and direct others with <span class="purple">positive certainty</span> - and that's what makes others willing to follow.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you're not one to shy away from the limelight - being the centre of attention comes natural to you.</p>
            
        <p>Your keen eye for detail ensures that whatever you set out to do is <span class="purple">meticulously executed with precision.</span></p>
        
        <p>Apart from that, you're also an individual who's <span class="purple">welcoming and open</span> - especially to people who you trust. You rarely shy away from opportunities to play the role of a listening ear, and you feed off information from others to make <span class="purple">sincere and unbiased choices.</span></p>
        
        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, as a Ruler, you're gallant and audacious when it comes to <span class="purple">taking massive action.</span> Whether it's embarking on an unfamiliar personal journey, or putting a new idea to the test, you're swift to move.</p>
            
        <p>Unlike other archetypes, you're not one to fear failure - you have a thorough understanding of failure, realizing that it's the <span class="purple">next step towards greatness.</span> In fact, you welcome it with open arms.</p>
        
        <p>You are not afraid to make difficult and unpopular decisions. When you have to put your foot down, you do not hesitate.</p> 
        
        <p>That's because you're willing to put your <span class="purple">reputation and image at stake</span> for the sake of your values, and for the good of others.</p>

        <p>In terms of your behaviour around others, you tend to be a little bit careful with your <span class="purple">choice of words.</span> You prefer to keep yourself censored, and you're always looking for the most politically correct way of putting things.</p>
        
        <p>You're fully aware that your words have the capacity to hurt or help others, and you'd very much prefer to use them with good intentions.</p>
        
        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is <span class="purple">Smooth-Sailing</span> For The Decisive Ruler, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the <span class="purple">potential challenges</span> that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your <span class="purple">Archetypal strengths and personality traits, </span>, you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p>The Ruler archetype tends to struggle with <span class="purple">spreading itself too thin.</span> At times, it might feel like you're needed everywhere all at once. It's likely that thoughts of cloning yourself or splitting yourself in half have crossed your mind.</p>
            
        <p>That challenge often stems from your refusal to seek help from others, perhaps from a lack of trust in the people around you.</p>
        
        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, that challenge originates from a deeper fear that resides within you... and that is your fear of <span class="purple">losing control.</span></p>
                
        <p>Perhaps your obsession with retaining power can at times be unwarranted, or even unnecessary - a self-inflicted belief that has convinced you that power is something that needs to be protected.</p>
        
        <p>It is important for you to realize that a lack of trust does not resonate well with others, and they do see it as well.</p> 
        
        <p>And that leads us to your greatest challenge of all, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span> - and that is <span class="purple">overcoming yourself.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, do not be alarmed - this is all part and parcel of what it means to be a <span class="purple">Member</span>. And with your Archetypal Introduction, all of that will soon change.</p>

        <p>The sooner you're aware of your struggles and weaknesses, the sooner you'll be able to experience the <span class="purple">wonders and greatness</span> that it has to offer. Working on that aspect of your personality will, in fact, reveal a part of your archetype that you never knew existed.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, it's important to understand that all archetypes has its fair share of <span class="purple">weaknesses and challenges</span>. Now that you're aware of them, you'll be able to pay attention to them, and then improve on them.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, As A Ruler, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are an excellent mediator when it comes to managing expectations – those from yourself, and from others. You’re always able to <span class="purple">maintain order</span> through your sense of understanding what people want..</p> 
        
        <p>This can be applied to both your personal and work relationships.</p>

        <p>Your talents in discerning right from wrong allows you to concuct fair solutions that are beneficial to all parties involved.</p>

        <p>Your calling in life will revolve primarily around those traits, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. As long as you're able to be in a position where you're able to make fair decisions and provide others with direction, you will find the fulfillment that you seek.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, but you must always remember that your sense of self-worth is not determined by your <span class="purple">ability to lead or to rule.</span> In fact, it is important for you to disassociate it completely from your identity.</p>
        
        <p>In eventuality, that is the true calling that you must answer to.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your <span class="purple">Love Compatibility</span> With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/ruler-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, the Ruler archetype is known to be <span class="purple">charismatic, assertive, and responsible</span> in a relationship... You often plan ahead of time, and potential romantic partners are often appreciative of that trait.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, but you must be aware that you do tend to come off as authoritative and domineering, which can be challenging attributes to have in a relationship. That often <span class="purple">tips the balance in opinions and perspectives,</span> and your partner will have to exercise a lot of patience and humility to constantly submit to you.</p>

        <p>You must bear in mind that relationships are always a two-way street, and the values and opinions of your partner needs to be listened to. Listening to your partner can in fact, be a lot more <span class="purple">empowering</span> than trying to impose your authority over him or her.</p>
        
        <p>It's unlikely that you'll encounter any trouble with finding <span class="purple">potential suitors,</span> but if you hold your cards too closely to your chest, you might lose the opportunity to find the one who's right for you.</p> 
        
        <p>With that being said, you must learn to be vulnerable and trusting, and through that, you will also learn to be a more <span class="purple">attentive, emotionally present lover.</span> That will translate into a rewarding romantic relationship.</p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, how you perceive yourself <span class="purple">should not be determined by your love life.</span> Romance is merely one, single aspect of life - not the only. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
