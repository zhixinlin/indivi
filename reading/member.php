        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/archetype-wheel.png">

        <p>Your <span class="purple">tendencies, your strengths, your weaknesses, and your innate personality traits.</span></p>

        <p>You must have guessed it by now, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>...</p>

        <p>Yes, you can use this information to make <span class="purple">astronomical changes</span> in your life!</p>

        <p>You can use it to leverage on your strengths to attain your goals and ambitions...</p>

        <p>And of course, you can use it to embark on the life that you've always dreamed of...</p>

        <p>But before we get into that, I want to share with you a little bit about your archetype, The Member, and what it means...</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, You Are The Member - And This Is <span class="purple">What It Means...</span></h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, the Member archetype is one of the most interesting and contributing archetypes in society... Essentially, the Members are the ones who form the <span class="purple">building blocks of the world...</span> The ones who subscribe and participate in great causes.</p>
            
        <p>As a Member, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are <span class="purple">charismatic, empathetic, and principled.</span></p>

        <p>Truth be told, the Member archetype is not merely one-dimensional. It has many different sides and faces, and as we progress through this <span class="purple">Archetypal Introduction</span>, you'll begin to understand what I mean. But before we proceed, please do so with with an open mind, and a willing heart.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, The Member archetype is one with that's exorbitantly talented in <span class="purple">connecting and networking with others.</span> You excel when it comes to <span class="purple">making others feel comfortable, and creating links between people.</span></p>

        <p>You're able to <span class="purple">motivate, drive, and inspire</span> others to succeed. You instinctively know the right words to say, and you're able to somehow blend into different social groups, and social circles.</p>

        <p>But what really sets you apart is your <span class="purple">passion for people.</span> Whether it's your friends, co-workers, loved ones, or more often than not, even strangers.</p>

        <!--Insert Archetype Icon-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/icons/member.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, as a Member, you're able to earn the trust of others with your transparency. Unlike other archetypes, you're not afraid to bare it all and prove to others that your <span class="purple">intentions are genuine.</span></p> 
        
        <p>That seems to spring from your <span class="purple">deep sensitivity to the emotions of others...</span> A sensitivity that allows you to notice when someone feels shy, fearful, depressed - no matter how hard they try to hide it.</p> 
        
        <p>It's a talent that cannot be explained by logic - but the best way to describe it, is that you have <span class="purple">a 'feeling' for feelings.</span></p>
        
        <p>People find themselves drawn to you because of your ability to engage in <span class="purple">deep, thoughtful conversations.</span> The bonds that you forge with others is one that's based on <span class="purple">trust, understanding, and and sincerity.</span></p> 
        
        <p>Your deep understanding of feelings and approachable appearance makes you a <span class="purple">warm and comforting presence to be around.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, this puts you at a great advantage when it comes to <span class="purple">meeting and building relationships with people who can help you grow.</span></p> 
        
        <p>As a Member, you <span class="purple">thrive on interacting with the world</span> - taking notice of everything that it has to offer... Its nature, its people, and its cultures.</p>

        <p>You offer balanced perspectives, always remembering that there's two sides to a story. That <span class="purple">theme of harmony</span> flows into your choice of words, and the the decisions that you make.</p>

        <p>You tend to make an excellent listener, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... You offer <span class="purple">valuable input about</span> tricky situations and disputes between others. That trait is emanated by your <span class="purple">principled stance, morals,a nd ethics.</span></p>

        <p>The Member archetype has a profound <span class="purple">connection to the world.</span> You're kind and considerate towards others' differences...</p>
            
        <p>But we'll discuss that in greater detail as we progress through this Archetypal Introduction, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">As A Member, These Are Your Strengths, Tendencies, And Positive Attributes...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are <span class="purple">trustworthy, accepting, and conscientious.</span></p> 
        
        <p>It's likely that you have a great number of friends - friends that you know you can <span class="purple">trust and depend on.</span> That's because your sincerity is almost always reciprocated.</p>

        <p>After all, kindness is a debt that can only  <span class="purple">be paid forward</span> - and in one way or another, it's always returned to its rightful benefactor.</p>

        <p>You do however, prefer to keep your circle of friends on the smaller side, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... Perhaps there's only a <span class="purple">select number of people</span> that you choose to spend most of your time with.
            
        <p>That's because of you tend to be more <span class="purple">careful about who you let into your life</span> - knowing that soured relationships can really dampen your mood.</p>
        
        <p>Apart from that, you're also an individual who's altruistic and charitable. You rarely shy away from opportunities to give - as long as you know that whatever you do is for a good cause...</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, based on the strengths of your archetype, you're best represented by your selflessness, your open-mindedness, and your charisma.</p>

        <!--Insert Strength Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/strength.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, as a Member, you're realistic and modest when it comes to your goals. You prefer to take <span class="purple">small steps,</span> rather than large leaps - a more conservative approach that's both sound and sensible.</p>
            
        <p>And that translates into how well you're able to connect with others - an indicator of your high <span class="purple">emotional quotient.</span></p>

        <p>Apart from that, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, it's likely that others often come to you for <span class="purple">direction and encouragement...</span></p> 
        
        <p>The Member archetype is uncanny when it comes to deciphering life lessons from sticky situations - translating them into <span class="purple">golden nuggets of wisdom.</span> 
        
        <p>The words that you speak are often <span class="purple">galvanizing</span>, and that stems from your tactfulness.</p>

        <p>In terms of your behaviour around others, you prefer not to be the centre of attention, especially when it comes to larger groups. The Member archetype is not one that shies away, but one that prefers to <span class="purple">listen, observe, and absorb its environment.</span></p>
        
        <p>Your archetype truly shows when it comes to interacting with smaller groups, knowing that your voice is not drowned out by <span class="purple">unnecessary noise.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, there are traits of profound leadership that are hidden within you - hidden because they have yet to be fully explored and cultivated. You're able to <span class="purple">rally support, and compel people</span> to believe in your cause.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Unfortunately, Not All Is <span class="purple">Smooth-Sailing</span> For The Magnanimous Member, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span></h2>

        <p>This portion of your Archetypal Introduction does not seek to scare you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... But it's best that you be made aware of the <span class="purple">potential challenges</span> that lie ahead of you - or perhaps you've encountered some of these challenges already.</p>

        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/sailing.png">

        <p>However, I have no doubt that with your <span class="purple">Archetypal strengths and personality traits, </span>, you will overcome all that stands in your way, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>

        <p>The Member archetype tends to struggle with <span class="purple">its concerns of being in the limelight</span> And that often drives you to be <span class="purple">less out-spoken and slightly more timid.</span></p>
            
        <p>But that's also indicative of a deeper fear that resides within you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... The fear of <span class="purple">rejection.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, as a Member, you've grown used to listening to other people's problems that you become a bit more reserved when it comes to talking about your own.</p> 
        
        <p>Perhaps there's a part of you that feels that it's burdensome to others, and you'd <span class="purple">rather bear it all on your own.</span></p> 
        
        <p>But that could not be further from the truth, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>. People are almost always interested to know more about you, and that includes your <span class="purple">frustrations, disappointments, and troubles.</span></p>
        
        <p>You must forego the limiting belief that<span class="purple">listening is all it takes,</span> and be <span class="purple">more open</span> about sharing your personal circumstances and your ideas.</p> 
        
        <p>This will allow you to tap into the strengths of your archetype, and really make full use of it to create <span class="purple">>even closer relations.</span</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, do not be alarmed - this is all part and parcel of what it means to be a <span class="purple">Member</span>. And with your Archetypal Introduction, all of that will soon change.</p>

        <p>The sooner you're aware of your struggles and weaknesses, the sooner you'll be able to experience the <span class="purple">wonders and greatness</span> that it has to offer. Working on that aspect of your personality will, in fact, reveal a part of your archetype that you never knew existed.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, it's important to understand that all archetypes has its fair share of <span class="purple">weaknesses and challenges</span>. Now that you're aware of them, you'll be able to pay attention to them, and then improve on them.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, As A Member, This Is Your Calling...</h2>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you are a social chameleon by your own right - an <span class="purple">emotionally intelligent</span> individual who blends into social environments of all shapes and forms.</p>

        <p>You have a special talent for communicating, and breaking language barriers. You're curious about other's beliefs and cultures, and that curiosity is often rewarded with <span class="purple">affinity and trust.</span></p>

        <p>Those personal strengths of your indicate something into your personality profile, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... They indicate that you will uncover fulfillment and joy from being active in a people-oriented role that will require you to do the things that you do best - <span class="purple">influence, persuade, and motivate.</span></p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you have the makings of an excellent leader. But you must remember to toe the lines of your comfort zone, and eventually, you will learn <span class="purple">to break free from the chains of your self-inflicted limitations.</span></p>

        <h2 class="sub-header"><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, Here's A Glimpse Into Your <span class="purple">Love Compatibility</span> With Other Archetypes...</h2>

        <img class="love-img" src="../img/love/member-love-compatibility.png">

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, do you see that chart on top? That little chart over there represents the archetypes that you’re most likely to end up with. Or if you’re already in a committed relationship, there’s a really good chance that your spouse is one of those archetypes.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, the Member archetype is known to be <span class="purple">sweet, attentive, and emotionally available</span> in a relationship... You're thoughtful and courteous  - attributes than any potential suitor would appreciate.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you tend to gravitate towards partners that are more <span class="purple">assertive and domineering</span> in a relationship - partners who are willing to take the reigns and dictate the direction.</p>

        <p>That gives you a sense of balance, but in all frankness, that's you <span class="purple">selling yourself short</span> - you're able to be assertive and decisive, and you need not limit your sights to individuals who exhibit such traits . You're perfectly capable of <span class="purple">taking charge </span>in a relationship, especially after you've explored that side of your identity.</p>

        <p>In the presence of your partner, you do tend to assume the more passive role. Of course, there's nothing wrong with that - but you must realize that there needs to be balance in any relationship. There are instances where you <span class="purple">must give, as well as take.</span> Likewise, there are also instances where you <span class="purple">must follow, as well as lead.</span></p>

        <p>But don’t forget, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, how you perceive yourself <span class="purple">should not be determined by your love life.</span> Romance is merely one, single aspect of life - not the only. It's always best to focus on your own personal growth, because that's the path that you must embark on to lead a rewarding and fulfilled life.</p>
