    <h2 class="sub-header">Before we end this miniature reading, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, I wanted to let you know that there's so much left to explore in your <span class="purple">Archetypal Profile...</span></h2>

        <p>...After all, we've yet to look into <span class="purple">your Shadow, your Anima/Animus, your Ego, and your Life Path.</span></p>

        <p>Your Shadow is the suppressed side of your personality. The <span class="purple">dark, hidden side</span> of who you are - where all of your innate tendencies, thoughts, and desires reside...</p>

        <p>Your Anima/Animus is the imbalance between <span class="purple">masculinity and femininity</span> in your personality.</p>

        <p>Your Ego is the <span class="purple">centre of your consciousness</span> - the part of you that needs to be controlled in order to discover your True Self.</p>

        <p>As you can see, there's so much left that I want to share with you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>!</p>

        <p>That's right, you CAN <span class="purple">gain insight</span> into ALL of that... Every single piece that forms the puzzle of your identity.</p>

        <p>And that includes...</p>

        <ul class="bullet-purple">
            <li>The reasons behind the <span class="goldenrod">choices</span> that you've made in your life</li>
            <li>The perfect <span class="goldenrod">life partner</span> or campanion based on your traits</li>
            <li>The <span class="goldenrod">quickest</span> path that you can take to attain extraordinary success</li>
            <li>Foresight into the potential <span class="goldenrod">challenges</span> that you have to overcome</li>
            <li>Your personal path towards unlocking a <span class="goldenrod">rewarding</span> life of fulfillment</li>
        </ul>

        <p>...Fortunately, you can receive all of that information pretty much instantly, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span></p>

        <p>And it's all made possible with your <span class="purple">Premium Archetypal Analysis</span> - an exhaustive examination of every single element of your personality...</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, this is an analysis that's extremely detailed, and of course, highly intimate...</p>

        <p>...Within this extraordinary analysis lies an experience like no other...</p>

        <p>An experience of enlightenment, wisdom, and life-changing insights.

        <h2 class="sub-header">You Will Encounter <span class="purple">Miracles</span> With This, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... Miracles That Will <span class="purple">Change Everything</span> You Knew About Yourself.</h2>

        <p>Your Premium Archetypal Analysis is a raw and unadulterated look into <span class="purple">your personality, and your identity</span> - as a lover, as a friend, as a colleague, as a human being.</p>

        <p>And it's all going to be presented to you in excruciating detail.</p>

        <p>It will be a truth-revealing experience, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, especially since you're already a little bit bewildered by your free reading.</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Here's Exactly What You Can Expect From Your Premium Archetypal Analysis, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span></h2>

        <p>With your Premium Archetypal Analysis, you'll finally be able to <span class="purple">muster the courage</span> to confront your internal struggles.</p>

        <p>You'll be guided through a liberating confrontation of all the <span class="purple">trials, tribulations, and misfortunes</span> that you've fought through.</p>

        <p>You'll pick up all the missing pieces in your life, and plug all of those voids that you've always felt.</p>

        <!--Insert Success Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/success.png">

        <p>You'll piece every <span class="purple">facet of your personality</span> back together and witness the true beauty that it forms.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, I want you to listen to your subconscious for a moment. Allow your mind to drift into a blank state...</p>

        <p>...Now, I want you to think of your <span class="purple">heart's deepest desires.</span> The things you've always wanted for yourself... Things that you've never achieved because of a lack of opportunity, or a lack of direction.</p>

        <p>Perhaps it's wealth and success... Perhaps it's a blissful marriage... Perhaps it's freedom of expectations... Or perhaps it's simply inner peace.</p>

        <p>Well, as soon as you're equipped with your Premium Archetypal Analysis, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, you'll discover two important things...</p>

        <p>The first thing you'll discover is <span class="purple">what you really want in this lifetime</span> - based on the configurations and tendencies of your archetype. In other words, your truest desires.</p>

        <p>It sounds easy enough to figure out, doesn't it? But the truth is, it's often the direct opposite of what you'd expect, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>.</p>


        <p>And no, it's not going to be about something that you can achieve in the physical world... </p>

        <p>Instead, it's something you can only achieve within the <span class="purple">domain of your psychological senses.</span></p>

        <p>Now, the second thing you'll discover is <span class="purple">your path to a fulfilled, and rewarding life.</span></p>

        <p>And no, this has nothing to do with fame and fortune. That's the beauty of Archetypes, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... As you can already tell, it's <span class="purple">far more profound</span> than that.</p>

        <p>The answers to all of your life’s questions, to all of your life’s complications, to all of your life’s encounters, failures, and successes, can be found within your Premium Archetypal Analysis, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>...</p>

        <p>If you’re unsure of the path that you’re currently on, your Premium Archetypal Analysis will help you navigate your way to your goals and ambitions.</p>

        <p>If you’re wondering whether your actions are right or wrong, this analysis will grant you unquestionable direction.</p>

        <p>If the people around you are holding you back, this report will give you all clarity you need.</p>

        <!--Insert Joy Image-->
        <img class="img-intext" src="../img/joy.png">

        <p>All of that information is readily available for you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... And it can all be found in your Premium Archetypal Analysis</p>

        <p>The insights within it will give you the answers you need to <span class="purple">make better decisions and embark on your true journey</span>... And it will all be handed to you on a silver platter.</p>

        <p><span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>, this is a journey that we're more than happy to guide you through... But we can't move forward unless you take the first step.</p>

        <p>...I want you to think about this for a second, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>...</p>

        <p>...Are you constantly worrying about your financial situation?</p>
        <p>...Are you constantly thinking about where you're going in life?</p>
        <p>...Are you constantly pondering about whether your love life isn't as great as it you think it is?</p>

        <h2 class="sub-header">Now, Tell Me This, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... Are You Eager To Take Back The Reigns And Choose Your Own Destiny?</h2>

        <p>Yes, I can see the <span class="purple">eagerness</span> that burns within you, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... </p>

        <p>You see, your Premium Archetypal Analysis is the <span class="purple">exact tool</span> that you've been searching for.</p>

        <p>That's because the Premium Archetypal Analysis is based on the process of Individuation... </p>

        <p>A process that's taken <span class="purple">THOUSANDS</span> of years of in-depth analysis, and painstaking research.</p>

        <p>That same process has been used, implemented, and improved by famous philosophers and psychologists... From the Renaissance, to the Middle Ages, dating all the way back to the days of <span class="purple">Ancient Greece!</span></p>

        <p>But that's not all, <span aweber-field="name">Friend</span>... Get ready for what I'm about to say next.</p>
