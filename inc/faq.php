<button class="accordion">Why should I buy from Individualogist?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>You could probably find a book about Individuation from a local book store, which will contain a chapter or a couple of pages about your archetype. But that single chapter or two pages isn’t going to be very helpful. So, here’s the truth.

The Premium Archetypal Analysis is an excruciatingly detailed report about your archetype, containing  highly informative pages of actionable and thought-provoking strategies and methodologies. Once again, all of the information is customized to your specific archetype. It breaks down an in-depth outlook of your life journey and all of its obstacles. There is no other product that comes as close in terms of detail or information.

The Premium Archetypal Analysis is 100% owned and authored by us. This is the only place where you’re able to get it, or anything like it.</p>

<button class="accordion">I've tried similar products before that didn't help. Why will this time be any different?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Other products assume that everyone functions and processes information in the same way. The law of attraction assumes that everyone is built with the same framework. Manifestation programs assume that everyone will respond the same way. Meditation methods assume that everyone experiences calmness similarly.

That is utter nonsense. We are all different individuals. We each have different fears, different circumstances, and different life experiences. Individuation and archetypes take that into account. Our readings are specifically catered to your archetype to provide you with actionable steps that you can take towards making a true change in your life. It reveals callings and directions that are specific to you.

That’s why it’s going to work. This product seeks to bring the term “personal” back into personal development; an industry littered with impersonal products that have strayed away from what personal development was meant to be.</p>

<button class="accordion">Is the Premium Archetypal Analysis really proven by Science?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>Absolutely. Individuation is a psychological process that was created by thought leaders in the psychological world decades ago. In fact, principles of Individuation can be traced all the way back to the days of Aristotle. This means that Individuation has stood the test of time to be a proven personal development process. There have also been numerous conclusive scientific studies about analytical psychology (what Individuation is based on) across the globe.</p>

<button class="accordion">What do I do about the materials from other similar programs?</button>
<div class="panel">
<p>The wonderful thing about the Premium Archetypal Analysis is that it can be applied in conjunction with virtually everything else that’s personal development related. This includes numerology, astrology, manifestation, meditation, tarot reading, the law of attraction, and practically every other program on the market.

Individuation seeks to holistically enhance your personal development growth, and accelerate your journey. It does not work against other programs, but works together with them.</p>
